There's a sweet old couple happily living life. One day the wife went in for a medical exam 
and when she came home she reported to her husband, "The doctor says I have the heart of a
 50-year-old, lungs of a 40-year-old, and the blood pressure of a 25-year-old."

The husband replies, "Oh really? And what did he say about your 70-year-old ass?"

She replied, "He never mentioned you."
